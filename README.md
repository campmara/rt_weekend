# rt_weekend

This is a personal code repository that entails my progress through the [*Raytracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) mini-textbook. The project is now __completed__, meaning that I most likely won't make any more commits to this in the future. I don't plan to update this renderer or make it faster or anything like that, and if I choose to do so, I will copy this code into a new repo.

This repository is probably not useful to anyone outside of myself, but I mostly wanted a way to publicly document my progress in learning how rendering and engine programming works.

## The Postmortem

I think this resource was mostly valuable to me from the perspective of getting a very bare understanding of how a renderer works (from a raytracing perspective). Of course, this is mostly doing software rendering and only outputting one basic ppm image (no frame-based realtime raytracing here), but I think because of that approach it helped me nail down some of the core concepts.

The math, though it made sense from a theory-to-application standpoint, was still very tough for me to fully grasp. While this was detailing a lot of concepts I was already somewhat familiar with (reflectance, rays, vector projections, etc.), some of the more complicated formulas are still somewhat elusive to me. I think over time I'll gain more intuition with these concepts, but for now I am happy with this serving as a mostly high-level overview.

Really enjoyed the camera abstraction work in here too, as I find thinking about & working with cameras to be quite fun.

### That's all! Bye!
